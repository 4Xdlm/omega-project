The happy warrior marched forward with joy in his heart. 
He trusted his companions and felt confident in their mission.
But fear crept in as the dark forest loomed ahead.
Suddenly, a surprising turn of events changed everything.
Sadness washed over him when he saw the destruction.
Anger filled his veins at the injustice of it all.
Yet anticipation of victory kept him moving forward.
