The mapping room held its familiar geometry beneath the city's buried streets. Lena's fingers traced the parchment's grain, feeling how yesterday's charcoal had settled into the paper's weave, each stroke now permanent as root systems threading through soil. The morning ritual began with touch—palm against palm, warming the joints that would guide her pen through Cendreville's underground arteries.

Steam rose from her tea, carrying mint and honey through air that tasted of limestone dust and the faint metallic tang of volcanic minerals. She breathed slowly, letting the warmth settle in her chest cavity, expanding against her ribs with measured precision. The city waited above in its ashen tomb, four centuries of burial creating this strange botanical existence—streets growing like underground branches, districts blooming in careful succession beneath tons of hardened lava.

Her predecessor's final map lay folded in the drawer. Unfinished.

Memory pressed against her sternum as she lifted her cartographer's pen, its brass weight familiar between thumb and forefinger. The nib caught morning light filtering through ventilation shafts, those careful channels that brought air and illumination to their buried world. She had mapped those shafts herself three years ago, tracing their angles with architectural precision, ensuring they would remain when dawn broke above the ash fields.

Streets that went unmapped simply ceased. The void beneath consumed them with botanical patience, absorption slow as tree growth, inevitable as seasonal change. Three districts had already been lost to her predecessor's failing memory—Quartier des Artisans, the old Marché aux Fleurs, the residential maze called Les Jardins Perdus. Their absence created thermal pockets in the city's underground structure, cold spaces where warmth once circulated through inhabited rooms.

Lena's throat tightened as she considered the weight of remembrance. Each line she drew carried the responsibility of existence, every curve and intersection a decision about what would survive until tomorrow's mapping. Her pulse threaded through her wrists as she positioned the pen above blank parchment, ready to begin the daily act of preservation.

The void called to her sometimes, its gravitational pull like the scent of turned earth after rain. She had felt its presence during her apprenticeship, that hungry emptiness that waited beneath even the deepest foundations. Her predecessor had tried to map it—had descended with measuring tools and determination, seeking to chart the unchartable. Only his boots had returned, placed neatly at the threshold of the mapping room, laces still tied, leather still warm.

Now Lena carried his knowledge in her fingertips, muscle memory of streets and squares encoded in the small bones of her hands. She began with the central plaza, pen moving in practiced arcs across the paper's surface. The charcoal dust mixed with morning moisture, creating lines that would dry into permanence, securing another day of existence for the fountain where children played, for the market stalls where vendors arranged their underground harvests.

Trust built itself through repetition. Each morning's map layered over yesterday's memory, creating sedimentary certainty in the act of preservation. Her breathing steadied as familiar patterns emerged—the curve of Rue des Vignes, the angular geometry of the administrative quarter, the organic sprawl of residential tunnels that had grown like root systems through the softer volcanic soil.

The temperature in the mapping room remained constant, thermal stability maintained by the city's geothermal systems. Heat rose from deep places, warming the stone floors where Lena's feet rested, circulation carrying comfort through her legs and up her spine. This warmth had outlasted empires, would outlast her own careful documentation. The volcanic burial that had seemed like ending had become beginning—protection, preservation, the foundation for this strange botanical civilization that flowered in darkness.

She mapped the greenhouse district with particular care, pen tracing the glass-domed spaces where actual plants grew in artificial light. These structures required precise documentation, their angles and connections critical to maintaining the atmospheric balance that kept both vegetation and citizens alive. The void could not claim what was properly charted, could not absorb what memory held in architectural precision.

Her shoulders relaxed as the morning's work progressed, tension releasing through the familiar choreography of cartographic creation. Each street secured was a small victory against entropy, each intersection preserved was proof that human intention could outlast geological catastrophe. The city breathed around her, air moving through mapped passages, life continuing in spaces that existed because she remembered them into being.

The final district took shape beneath her pen as morning light strengthened in the ventilation shafts. Quartier de l'Espoir, where the youngest families lived, where children learned the underground navigation that would keep them safe in a world where getting lost meant more than inconvenience. She drew their playground with botanical attention to detail, capturing the curved benches where parents sat, the climbing structures that mimicked surface trees their children would never see.

Trust accumulated in the completed map like sediment in still water. Layer upon layer of careful observation, each line a promise that tomorrow would find the same streets, the same safety, the same warm circulation of air through passages that connected one underground garden to the next. Lena set down her pen, flexing fingers that held the city's continued existence in their trained movements.

The void waited, patient as stone, hungry as earth. But today's map was finished, complete, perfect in its preservation of what mattered most—the spaces where trust could take root and grow, botanical and architectural, through another day of buried sunlight.
