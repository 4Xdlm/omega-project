The cartographer's hands moved across the paper with the certainty of root systems finding water. Each line Lena drew carried the weight of permanence, the ink settling into fiber like memory into bone. Dawn pressed against the workshop windows, but she had been mapping since before the first gray touched the horizon.

Her fingers traced the outline of Rue des Cendres, feeling the paper's texture beneath her palm. The street existed because she remembered its cobblestones, the way they caught rainwater in their worn grooves, the particular slant of light that fell between the buildings at midday. Trust lived in these details. The city breathed through her precision.

She paused. The void waited below.

Every morning brought the same ritual, the same careful reconstruction of a world that existed only as long as someone could hold its shape in memory. Three districts had already fallen to forgetting—entire neighborhoods swallowed by the absence beneath Cendreville, their unmapped streets dissolving into the dark that consumed forgotten places.

The workshop smelled of ink and old paper, familiar scents that anchored her to purpose. Her predecessor's final map still hung on the wall, incomplete, its edges trailing off into white space where he had tried to chart the void itself. The paper there looked burned, though no flame had touched it.

Lena's throat tightened as she considered the morning's work. The eastern quarter needed reinforcement—she had felt it wavering yesterday, the buildings growing translucent at their edges where her memory had grown thin. But memory was layered like sediment, and trust accumulated in the careful repetition of detail.

Her pen moved again, sketching the fountain in Place Souterraine. She could feel the cool mist on her skin, hear the water's steady percussion against stone. These sensations became lines, became permanence, became the difference between existence and the hungry dark below.

The void called to her sometimes. Not with words, but with the promise of understanding. What lay beneath the forgotten places? What happened to streets when they ceased to be mapped, to buildings when they slipped from memory's grasp?

She shook her head, focusing on the present task. The bakery on Rue Thermale needed its windows drawn with particular care—she remembered how the warmth leaked through the glass even in the coldest months, how the smell of bread created its own geography of comfort and sustenance.

Trust grew in these accumulations. Each mapped detail was a vote of confidence in the city's continued existence, a declaration that Cendreville would persist beneath its shroud of ash because someone believed strongly enough in its streets to draw them into being every dawn.

Her pulse thickened as she approached the map's southern edge, where her predecessor's work had grown erratic in his final weeks. The lines there showed uncertainty, streets that bent impossibly or ended in contradictions. He had been trying to map what could not be mapped, to give form to absence itself.

The paper beneath her hand grew warm. Memory was thermal, she realized—it retained heat, stored it in the careful repetition of architectural truth. The void was cold, absolute zero, the temperature of forgetting.

She drew the pharmacy's door, remembering its weight, the way the hinges protested with each opening. These physical truths became her foundation. The city existed in the accumulation of such details, in the patient reconstruction of a world that had learned to survive on the strength of one person's daily faith.

Outside, true dawn arrived. The light changed, grew stronger, and with it came the familiar certainty that another day had been preserved, another map completed. The void could wait. It had been waiting for four hundred years, patient as stone, hungry as silence.

But today was not its day. Today belonged to trust, to the warm certainty of ink on paper, to the botanical precision of memory taking root in the careful architecture of lines that would hold Cendreville in existence until tomorrow's dawn demanded the ritual begin again.

Her hands stilled. The map was complete.
