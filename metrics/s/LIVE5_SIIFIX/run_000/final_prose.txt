The chalk dust settles between Lena's fingers as she traces the first line across fresh parchment, the familiar weight of morning ritual anchoring her to this underground chamber where maps birth streets into existence. Steam rises from her tea—chamomile and mint—while the oil lamp's flame flickers against stone walls that have known four centuries of ash-filtered darkness. Each stroke of her charcoal carries the weight of preservation.

Her predecessor's final map hangs beside her workspace, its edges curled and yellowed, three districts marked in red ink where streets once ran. Gone now. The void beneath claimed them when dawn arrived unmapped, when memory failed to hold their coordinates steady in the world's architecture.

Lena's breath forms small clouds in the cool air as she sketches the market square's boundaries, her palm pressing warmth into the paper's grain. The lines emerge from muscle memory—twenty-three paces from the fountain to the baker's door, seventeen more to where the flower seller arranges her displays each morning. Trust builds in these measurements, in the accumulated certainty of footsteps counted and recounted.

The charcoal snaps.

She selects another stick, rolling it between her palms until the graphite warms. Her throat tightens with the knowledge that three more streets have begun to fade at their edges, their cobblestones growing translucent where her memory wavers. The weight settles in her chest as she forces her hand to continue, marking boundaries that must hold until sunrise completes the spell of cartographic resurrection.

Through the stone ceiling, she hears the muffled sounds of Cendreville stirring—footsteps on mapped pathways, doors opening onto streets that exist because yesterday she remembered them whole. The temperature drops as doubt creeps between her ribs, but her fingers maintain their steady rhythm, building trust stroke by stroke.

The map spreads beneath her hands like a prayer made visible, each district a testament to the accumulated faith of four hundred years of underground cartographers. Her pulse beats against her wrist where it rests on the paper's edge, marking time in the same rhythm that governs the city's daily resurrection. The flame gutters, shadows dancing across the walls in patterns that echo the streets she draws.

Here, in this chamber where memory becomes geography, trust grows not through declaration but through the patient accumulation of lines that refuse to let places die. The chalk dust coats her fingertips like benediction, and somewhere above, Cendreville prepares to wake into another day of careful existence.

Her hand moves without hesitation now, tracing the familiar curves of Rue des Souvenirs, where morning light filters through ash-glass windows and the scent of baking bread promises continuity. Each mark deepens the city's hold on reality, each completed section a small victory against the void's hunger for forgotten spaces.

The map breathes beneath her touch, alive with the trust she places in memory's architecture.
