## Source Commit

**Commit ID**: `6595bc99f98b026e5e7da7335c53f3194e16273a`

## Generation Method

6-pass autonomous extraction protocol:
- B0: Census (repository inventory)
- B1: AST Extraction (functions, types, exports)
- B2: Test & Invariants (test coverage, invariant mapping)
- B3: Dependency Graph (module relationships)
- B4: Metrics & Cards (complexity, documentation)
- B5: Manifest & ZIP (SHA256 checksums, archive)
- S0: Emotional DNA Standard

## Exclusions

The following directories and patterns were excluded from extraction:
- `node_modules/` - Third-party dependencies
- `dist/` - Build output
- `coverage/` - Test coverage reports
- `.git/` - Git repository metadata

## Determinism Guarantees

- **INV-BP-01**: All outputs sorted alphabetically
- **INV-BP-02**: Exclusions consistently applied
- **INV-BP-03**: Write isolation enforced (nexus/blueprint/, tools/blueprint/ only)
- **INV-BP-04**: Index reconstructible (all references exist)
- **INV-BP-09**: SHA256 computed for each file
- **INV-BP-10**: ZIP archive created with sorted entries

## Scope and Limitations

This Blueprint Pack represents a **structural snapshot only**:
- Documents codebase architecture, not executable code
- Contains metadata, graphs, and module cards
- No transfer of intellectual property rights
- No warranty of completeness or accuracy
- For internal analysis and documentation purposes only
