# QA_07_COVERAGE.md

## Coverage Status
- **Script available**: `npm run test:coverage` exists in package.json
- **Execution**: Not run during this scan (would require c8/istanbul which may not be installed)
- **Impact**: No coverage metrics available for this scan

## Recommendation
Run `npm run test:coverage` separately to generate coverage report.
