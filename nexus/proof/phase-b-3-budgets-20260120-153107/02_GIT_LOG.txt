    feat(perf): add performance budgets and tracking [PHASE-B.3]
    
    Phase B.3 - Performance Budgets:
    - PERFORMANCE_BUDGETS.md: Budget definitions and policies
    - scripts/track-performance.ts: Budget tracking tool (npm run perf:track)
    - tests/performance/budgets.test.ts: 4 measurement tests (no timing assertions)
    
    Budget Status (all EXCELLENT):
    - Atlas operations: <1% of budget
    - Raw operations: <2% of budget
    - Proof operations: <3% of budget
    
    CRITICAL (VERROU 2): Tests measure but don't assert timing
    
    Tests: 2031/2031 PASS (+4 new)
