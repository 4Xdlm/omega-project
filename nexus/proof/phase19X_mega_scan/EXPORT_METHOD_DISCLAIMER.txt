EXPORT SYMBOL EXTRACTION - HEURISTIC METHOD (REGEX)
====================================================
This is NOT a formal AST parse. Results are approximate.

Limitations:
- May miss: export { X }, export default, re-exports
- May include: exports in comments or strings
- Arrow functions detected via 'export const X = ('

For formal AST analysis, use ts-morph or TypeScript compiler API.
