## What Was Invalidated

### tools/harness/ (Old TS Harness)
- Status: INVALID
- Reason: Syntax errors, skeleton-only code that throws on execution

### tools/harness_v2/ (MJS Harness)
- Status: STUB ONLY
- Reason: Generates placeholder artifacts without real GENESIS FORGE execution

### nexus/proof/phase_b/ old artifacts
- Status: INVALID
- Reason: Generated by broken/stub harnesses

## Replacement
- tools/harness_official/ - New TypeScript harness with real GENESIS FORGE integration
- docs/phase-b/B123_CONTRACT.md - Formal specification
